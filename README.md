This is a programming language or something. Written in Rust, syntax inspired by Rust, compiled by LLVM.
Many things are broken and many features are missing, as I mostly implement whatever seems fun at the moment. 
There's no tests, but hopefully there will be a time when I'll find them fun enough to create them.
Being useful in any way beyond having fun during development is not a goal of this project.
